"ï¿¼ Mobile Mapping is the process of collecting geospatial data from mobile"
" vehicles such as cars, drones, boats, trains or aeroplanes. In SmartGIS,"
" we can use two types of data derived from Mobile Mapping: Point clouds "
"and panoramic images."

"A point cloud is a set of points in space that represent the surface of "
"an object. Two common methods are used to generate point clouds: LiDAR "
"and photogrammetry. **LiDAR** s a technology that uses lasers in order to"
" measure distances from the sensor on the LiDAR device to objects in the "
"environment. **Photgrammetry** uses photographs taken from various angles"
" of an object in order to calculate its dimensions and generate a 3D "
"model by using triangulation. These point clouds can be used in SmartGIS "
"for :ref:`3D digitization <3d_digitizing>` of map objects."

"A panoramic photography is essentially a photo with a wide format, "
"whether that's vertical or horizontal. Either way, they are taken by "
"taking a series of photos which overlap to create one single image. "
"Mobile mapping data is always uploaded via FTP."

"The common file format for point clouds is LAS (or comressed LAZ). LAS "
"files collected in a bundle are called **trajectories**. Such "
"trajectories can be imported into the application packed in **.zip**, "
"**.rar** or **.7z** format. In the process, the files are unpacked and "
"prepared for web display, which requires the **Potree** format."

"In SmartGIS, each panorama image series must belong to a trajectory. The "
"images of the trajectory should also be packed in a .zip .rar or .7z "

"containing a list of the images. This will include the position of each "
"image and other information."
