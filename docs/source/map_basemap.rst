Basemaps
========

A basemap is a background map that provides context and reference for the data being analyzed and displayed. Basemaps typically include political boundaries, bodies of water, and physical features such as roads, land use, and terrain. They can also include satellite imagery, street maps, or other data layers that provide context and reference for the data being analyzed.

The role of a basemap in a GIS application is to provide a visual representation of the geographic context for the data being analyzed, making it easier to understand the relationships between data and geography. Basemaps can also provide a reference for navigation and help users orient themselves when exploring and analyzing data.

Adding basemaps
---------------

Basemaps can be created from data sources in the following ways:

* **Datasource can be marked as basemap on** :ref:`Datasource edit form <datasource_edit>`

   Mark datasource as basemap

* **External datasources treated always as basemaps**

.. figure:: images/basemap_external.png
   :align: center

   External datasources are listed in base maps section

* **Create a basemap layer from the datasource library**

Click on **+** to add new basemap and use the :ref:`Layer creation <layer_creation>` to create a compound basemap from several datasources.
