Main features
=============
SmartGIS is a modern web-based software for digitizing spatial data and displaying it in 2D and 3D environments. Artificial intelligence-based tools and algorithms further assist users in the tasks of recognizing and classifying digital objects.

Main features and benefits:

* Effective data management
* Mobility and cooperation
* Intuitive user interface
* Applicability in various projects
* Ideal for dislocated teams

Data management
---------------
Tools for managing geospatial data, such as importing, exporting, viewing, archiving, merging, cleaning, correcting and categorizing photos and point clouds.

Mobility and collaboration
--------------------------
SmartGIS can serve large and often remote teams. Collaboration and simultaneous work on projects, as well as data exchange and processing means savings in time and money. The possibility of using pallication from the office but also from the field gives added value to the teams working on digitization - they are not tied to one location or workstation, but can complete projects faster, more efficiently and with a higher quality result.

AI supported
------------
Tools and algorithms based on artificial intelligence are built into the application, for automatic recognition of digital objects, automatic export, conversion or integration of obtained data.

Applicability and client target group
--------------------------------------
SmartGIS can be used by public institutions and companies, local governments, traffic secretariats, urban planning agencies, etc. as well as stakeholders of the "Smart City" initiative; private companies dealing with field mapping and digitization of roads, traffic signals, bridges, buildings and structures, greenery, pipelines, transmission lines, or other important objects that need to be digitized due to legal regulations, regulations or business processes.

Work online or install the platform on-premises
-----------------------------------------------
You can use SmartGIS online, where we create a copy of the application and host it on a cloud server. 
It is also possible to install the complete system on the customer's server. In this case you must meet certain requirements:

* linux 
* docker installed > 19.0.3
* docker-compose installed > 1.29.2
* ssh access and public ip during installation


Business and general values
---------------------------
By adopting new digital tools and clear procedures, users will significantly reduce the manual work that characterized most digitization processes; will be able to expand the portfolio of services by offering new ways of working; they will get better quality data in less time and with less invested human and financial resources; on the other hand, the community gets new and improved existing public services, more accurate data and greater transparency.

Based on modern technologies
----------------------------
SmartGIS is built as a web application, with some offline components that are ideal for smaller and simpler projects, with limited seton functions and tools. The client-server architecture enables easy, fast and efficient use regardless of location (Internet connection is necessary). The software also works on average PCs/laptops on modern Internet browsers.
