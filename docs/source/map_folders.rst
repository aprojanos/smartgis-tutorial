Adding layers to the map
========================

We can fill the map with content in the LAYERS tab of the map editor. Layers are sorted into folders, first you need to create the folders and add the layers in them.

Folders
-------

Layer folders refer to the grouping of map layers into a hierarchical structure, allowing users to easily manage and organize complex maps with multiple layers. In a map legend with layer folders, individual map layers can be organized into folders providing a clear and organized view of the map data.

Layer folders are commonly used to group related map layers, such as all the layers for a particular city or region, or all the layers for a specific type of data, such as transportation, land use, or demographic data.

By organizing map layers into folders, users can turn multiple layers on and off at once, making it easier to compare and analyze different map scenarios. Additionally, layer folders can be expanded and collapsed, allowing users to focus on specific map data as needed.
