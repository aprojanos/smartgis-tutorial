Maps - Projects
===============

The SmartGIS application presents and works on map-based projects. These projects or maps are constructed from the :ref:`data sources<datasources>` and :ref:`trajectories<pointclouds>` discussed in the previous chapters.

Project administration pages can be accessed from the sidebar: :ref:`Administration->Projects<mapadmin>`.
